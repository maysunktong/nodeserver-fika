  Coffee is an essential part of Swedish culture, deeply tied to the tradition
  of *fika*, a daily ritual of pausing for coffee and a sweet treat. Sweden is
  among the top coffee-consuming countries in the world, with Swedes preferring
  strong, black coffee, often brewed using a drip coffee maker or *bryggkaffe*
  (boiled coffee). Espresso-based drinks are also popular, especially in urban
  cafés. Traditional Swedish coffee often accompanies pastries like
  *kanelbullar* or *kardemummabullar*. Social and unhurried, coffee breaks in
  Sweden are about more than caffeine—they foster connection, relaxation, and a
  sense of well-being in everyday life.
