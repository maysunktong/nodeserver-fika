Kanelbullar
Kanelbullar, or Swedish cinnamon buns, are a staple of fika, Swedenâ€™s coffee break tradition. These soft, aromatic buns are made with a rich, yeasted dough infused with butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Unlike American cinnamon rolls, kanelbullar are less sweet and often braided or twisted before baking. They are typically sprinkled with pearl sugar instead of frosting, giving them a delicate crunch. The addition of cardamom to the dough enhances their warm, spiced flavor. Enjoyed with coffee or tea, kanelbullar represent comfort and tradition in Swedish culture, making them a must-have for any fika gathering.
