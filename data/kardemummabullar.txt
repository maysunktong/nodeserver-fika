Kardemummabullar
Kardemummabullar, or Swedish cardamom buns, are a fragrant and flavorful alternative to kanelbullar. Made with the same enriched dough, they are generously spiced with ground cardamom and filled with a buttery sugar mixture. The buns are often twisted into intricate knots, creating beautiful, layered pastries that enhance their texture. Unlike kanelbullar, which highlight cinnamon, kardemummabullar focus on the citrusy, floral notes of cardamom. Finished with pearl sugar or brushed with syrup for a glossy shine, these buns are a Swedish favorite, offering a delicate balance of spice and sweetness, perfect for fika or a cozy afternoon treat.
