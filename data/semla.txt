Semla
Semla is a traditional Swedish pastry enjoyed primarily during Lent, especially on Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday). It consists of a soft, cardamom-flavored wheat bun, sliced open and filled with almond paste and a generous amount of whipped cream. The top is placed back on and dusted with powdered sugar. Originally eaten soaked in warm milk, the modern semla is enjoyed as a standalone dessert. Over time, creative variations have emerged, such as semmelwraps or chocolate-filled versions. Rich yet airy, semla is a beloved seasonal treat that signals the arrival of spring while offering indulgence in every bite.
