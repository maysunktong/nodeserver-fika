Swedish sandwiches are a staple in Swedish cuisine, often enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or a light meal. They are typically open-faced, served on hearty rye or crispbread (*knäckebröd*), and topped with various ingredients. A classic favorite is *räksmörgås*, an open-faced shrimp sandwich with mayonnaise, boiled eggs, lettuce, and dill on buttered bread. *Leverpastejmacka* (liver pâté sandwich) is another traditional choice, often served with pickles. Swedes also enjoy *ostmacka* (cheese sandwich) or *kaviar och ägg* (fish roe and egg on crispbread). Simple yet flavorful, Swedish sandwiches emphasize fresh, high-quality ingredients and are a vital part of daily meals.
